# MNIST-Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
A validation dataset of size 12,000 was deduced from the Training dataset with its size being changed to 48,000
This linear model uses 784 nodes (image pixels) at input layer, 512, 256 nodes in the first and second hidden layer, with the ouput layer of 10 nodes each for a class.
A "model.pt" file has been included. With this one can directly load the model state_dict and use for testing. 
This model achieves 98% overall accuracy.
